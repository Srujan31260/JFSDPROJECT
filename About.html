        <p class="p-about"><span>ABOUT</span><br>Improving interaction between politicians and citizens means making it easier for people to communicate with their 
            elected leaders. This can help citizens share their concerns, give feedback and stay updated on what the politicians
             are doing. By strengthening this connection, politicians can better understand what their community needs and citizens
              can feel more heard and involved in the decision-making process. This leads to a more transparent and responsive 
              government.</p>
